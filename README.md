# Celebrity_Image_Classification

At this project I have worked on some image datas. 

Firstly I downloaded all datas from google photos manually, after that I have detected the images for crop face and eyes.
For detecting eyes and faces, I used cascade functions and also openCV library.


In the second step, I developed some code for preparing images and then I put all images on the machine learning algorithms which are **Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest and Logistic Regression**.
I have 85 percent model score with **logistic regression** that is why I have made predict with that algorithm. When I finish the machine learning part, I developed web front-end and back-end part.


In conclusion I have a project that I do classify image to predict celebrities.
